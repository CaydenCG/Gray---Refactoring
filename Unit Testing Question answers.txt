Unit testing is the process of testing seperate pieces of code in a program rather than testing the entire thing. The tests are generally functions which evaluate wether or not the outcome was expected. Unit testing benefits the programmer by allowing them to find problems they might not have otherwise seen. This allows the programmer to feel more confident in their program and makes it easier to follow.
